# 🏠 Housing Affordability & Household Dynamics in Canada  
*A GLOCAL CSJ Capstone Project | Summer 2025*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores **housing affordability, mortgage trends, and household structure evolution in Canada**, with a specific focus on core housing need and lived experiences of vulnerable populations. The work draws exclusively from **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)** datasets and surveys, and aims to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to inform policy and public understanding.


## 🎯 Project Scope

The dashboard and accompanying analysis will be structured into five key themes:

### 1. **Mortgage Rates & Delinquency Risk**
- Explore provincial mortgage interest rate trends (short vs. long term)
- Visualize delinquency rate trajectories from 2012 to 2024
- Identify high-risk regions and timeframes for mortgage stress

### 2. **Core Housing Need & Affordability Pressures**
- Visualize historical CHN data (1991–2021) by province and tenure
- Compare CHN rates among renters vs. owners, and low-income groups
- Integrate shelter-cost-to-income (STIR) indicators where available

### 3. **Household Structure & Tenure Trends**
- Analyze how family types (1-person, 2-person, etc.) have evolved since 1971
- Compare renting vs. ownership trends across decades
- Show age-based variation in household formation

### 4. **2024 Rental Market Snapshot**
- Use RMR 2024 data to show average rent levels and vacancy rates across CMAs
- Compare housing market tightness across provinces and regions

### 5. **Housing Satisfaction & Survey Insights**
- Extract key insights from CHS and social housing surveys
- Visualize satisfaction scores, affordability stress, and support-seeking behavior
- Highlight regional or demographic disparities in lived experience
